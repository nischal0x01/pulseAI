# Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation

A machine learning project for estimating blood pressure from PPG (Photoplethysmography) and ECG (Electrocardiography) signals using deep learning techniques. This project implements CNN-based feature extraction combined with various regression models for non-invasive blood pressure prediction.
